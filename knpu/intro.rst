Introduction
============

Welcome back for part 3 of our Starting in Symfony2 series. If you've been
with us the whole way, then you've already seen a lot, from routing and templating
to Doctrine and quite a bit about security. In part 3 of this series, we're
going to discover even more about Symfony and begin to learn more about how
Symfony really works under the hood. Over the next hour or so, we're going
to learn what a service is, find out more about the core Symfony services,
and create a few of our own. In Doctrine, we'll create some Doctrine associations,
including ManyToOne and ManyToMany relationships. We'll also talk about lifecycle
callbacks and event listeners. Plus a ton more!

As we work through things, code along with us! By this point, you should be
feeling more comfortable creating new classes, routes and templates, but
practice is the key. And when you see new concepts, stop the video, investigate,
play with them, and then keep going. Ultimately, looking inside some of Symfony's
own classes is a great way to get even more comfortable.

Ok let's roll!
